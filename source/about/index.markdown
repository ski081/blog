My name is Mark Struzinski. I am from Denver, North Carolina in the United States. I build software for iPhones and iPads.

I am available for hire on a contract basis for iOS application development. I have been programming iOS apps since 2009.

I have been programming since early 2003. I started with Microsoft technologies, using coding as a way to improve my workflows during my day to day tasks as a business analyst. I quickly discovered I enjoyed coding much more than my day job. I moved into iOS to learn some new things, and found that I liked working in the Apple ecosystem. I went to work for a startup based out of San Diego ([Flud](http://www.flud.it/)), and worked on the iOS app up to version 2.5 before leaving for other opportunities.
