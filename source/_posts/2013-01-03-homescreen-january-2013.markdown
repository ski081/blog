I’m going to try to do a post once per month detailing my current iPhone homescreen. If it works out well, I might also do one a month for the iPad as well. Below is a screenshot of my current homescreen.

## Some of my favorites

**Apple folder**

Not a whole lot to note in here. This is just a quick collection of the stock Apple apps. Mostly, it’s a place to quickly get to SMS, settings, the App Store, and Mobile Safari.

[**Camera Awesome**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M)

I’m using this one in place of the stock Apple camera app. It’s fast and has a nice set of features, including big button (turns the entire screen into the shutter button) and burst mode. I used Camera+ for a long time, but lately it has become very slow to load and crashes a lot.

[**Capture**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M)

Great utility app that does one thing well: launches a video recorder **fast**.

**Mail**

Need this one for work, since Sparrow doesn’t support exchange accounts.

## Dock
**Phone**

Does its job very well. I have no complaints.

[**Sparrow**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M)

So far, the absolute best iOS mail app I have used. Sparrow still receives periodic updates, even though it isn’t getting any further feature development. 

[**Fantastical**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M)

Agenda used to occupy this spot, but Fantastical introduced some very thoughtful UI around the calendar, and it has the best blend of features and functionality I have seen.

[**Launch Center Pro**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M)

Many posts have been written about how great this app is. I use it to get to everything else on my phone. It has replaced 3 rows of apps on my homescreen. The custom action support is awesome.
