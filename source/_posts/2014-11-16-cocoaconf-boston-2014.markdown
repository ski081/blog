I attended the Boston stop of the [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com) tour this year. As always, it was a quality experience. I learned a ton, and I'm still processing all the valuable information that was crammed into my brain. The Klein family puts together a great mix of technical content, community interaction, and fun events. 

The speakers were top notch. I got to meet [Ben Scheirman](https://twitter.com/subdigital) of [NSScreenCast](https://www.nsscreencast.com) fame, who I've admired for a long time. Both of his talks were packed full of useful information. [Laura Savinola](https://twitter.com/savinola) had my favorite session, which was basically 45 straight minutes of Xcode tips, tricks, and hacks. (Lots of note-taking in that one!) 

The event is paced so that the technical content is buffered with 15 minute breaks, less technical talks, and meals in-between. In my opinion, this prevents your brain from being completely overwhelmed with technical content.
