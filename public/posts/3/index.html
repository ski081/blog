			Quick Xcode 4 Tip: Deleting Derived Data to Rescue Code Completion</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Quick Tip:</h2>

<p>I had an issue on a very large project in XCode. Starting 2 days ago, all of my syntax highlighting was completely broken. This is bad, but even worse, my code completion worked only partially. I was getting autocomplete for local variables only. When calling framework methods with a lot of parameters, I rely pretty heavily on code completion. I tried all of the usual fixes.</p>

			BackBlaze, MDS Worker, and Spotlight</a>

		<p>I recently began experiencing my system fans kicking in and running all the time. The fans began running so much that I almost didn&rsquo;t notice them any more. When I pulled the Activity Monitor up, the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/09/14/mdworker-what-is-mdworker/">md worker</a> was using over 100% of my system resources consistently.</p>

<p>After looking up what md worker does, it appears to be a process spun off by spotlight to index your drive for quick searching. Even after a reboot, the fans would kick back in after a short idle time of maybe a minute. This process was seriously heating up the mac.</p>

			On Discovering New APIs</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In working with any programming language, I&rsquo;ve always found that if you seem to be fighting things to get work done, you&rsquo;re probably doing it wrong. This is especially true in Cocoa Touch. When I was first learning the frameworks, I read a lot of blogs, books, and any other materials I could get my hands on. Almost everyone said something to the effect of <em>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it? Read the docs again.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>It took me a while to realize that Apple has excellent documentation. It&rsquo;s gotten a lot better in the Microsoft world, but in the C# 2.0 and 3.5 days, you would frequently go in search of a particular framework method or property, and come across a blank page that was obviously generated by some kind of tool. Or, my favorite was when you had a property that was named something like ToolsArray, and the description would contain verbiage like &ldquo;The array that holds the tools&rdquo;.</p>

			Using NSXMLParser</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my first stab at an iPhone project. I&rsquo;m writing an app that consumes an RSS feed and parses it to retrieve a few bits of information for display on the screen. This is my first attempt at an implementation. Coming from a .NET background, it is quite a paradigm shift when switching to the heavily convention based world of Cocoa    development.</p>

<p>If I was writing this app in .NET, I&rsquo;d go out looking for the proper class libraries to parse the XML and begin framing out a class to perform all the functions I needed to populate an object to be   persisted to the UI.</p>
