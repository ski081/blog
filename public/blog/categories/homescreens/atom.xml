    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to try to do a post once per month detailing my current iPhone homescreen. If it works out well, I might also do one a month for the iPad as well. Below is a screenshot of my current homescreen.</p>

<h2>Some of my favorites</h2>

<p><strong>Apple folder</strong></p>

<p>Not a whole lot to note in here. This is just a quick collection of the stock Apple apps. Mostly, it’s a place to quickly get to SMS, settings, the App Store, and Mobile Safari.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M"><strong>Camera Awesome</strong></a></p>

<p>I’m using this one in place of the stock Apple camera app. It’s fast and has a nice set of features, including big button (turns the entire screen into the shutter button) and burst mode. I used Camera+ for a long time, but lately it has become very slow to load and crashes a lot.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M"><strong>Capture</strong></a></p>

<p>Great utility app that does one thing well: launches a video recorder <strong>fast</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Mail</strong></p>

<p>Need this one for work, since Sparrow doesn’t support exchange accounts.</p>

<h2>Dock</h2>

<p><strong>Phone</strong></p>

<p>Does its job very well. I have no complaints.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M"><strong>Sparrow</strong></a></p>

<p>So far, the absolute best iOS mail app I have used. Sparrow still receives periodic updates, even though it isn’t getting any further feature development.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M"><strong>Fantastical</strong></a></p>

<p>Agenda used to occupy this spot, but Fantastical introduced some very thoughtful UI around the calendar, and it has the best blend of features and functionality I have seen.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=QZ1CsQ8cm0M"><strong>Launch Center Pro</strong></a></p>

<p>Many posts have been written about how great this app is. I use it to get to everything else on my phone. It has replaced 3 rows of apps on my homescreen. The custom action support is awesome.</p>
