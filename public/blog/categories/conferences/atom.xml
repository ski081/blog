    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended the Boston stop of the <a href="http://cocoaconf.com">CocoaConf</a> tour this year. As always, it was a quality experience. I learned a ton, and I&rsquo;m still processing all the valuable information that was crammed into my brain. The Klein family puts together a great mix of technical content, community interaction, and fun events.</p>

<p>The speakers were top notch. I got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/subdigital">Ben Scheirman</a> of <a href="https://www.nsscreencast.com">NSScreenCast</a> fame, who I&rsquo;ve admired for a long time. Both of his talks were packed full of useful information. <a href="https://twitter.com/savinola">Laura Savinola</a> had my favorite session, which was basically 45 straight minutes of Xcode tips, tricks, and hacks. (Lots of note-taking in that one!)</p>

<p>The event is paced so that the technical content is buffered with 15 minute breaks, less technical talks, and meals in-between. In my opinion, this prevents your brain from being completely overwhelmed with technical content.</p>
